# Give VIM a chance

## Intro

I've been jumping around the most widely known text editors for the past 7 years or so. None of them really stuck, but particularly VIM never got his chance.

The plan is to give VIM a chance, starting with a fresh new install. I will track my every move, to help others jump into this world.

In this repo I will track the evolution of my config files along with the rationale behind each addition.

## How to use

Read the readme (it's this file), then

		git clone git@github.com/leanucci/vim-stuff.git ~/vim-stuff
		ln -s ~/vim-stuff/vimrc ~/.vimrc
		ln -s ~/vim-stuff ~/.vim
