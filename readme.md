# Give VIM a chance

## Intro

I've been jumping around the most widely known text editors for the past 7 years or so. None of them really stuck, but particularly VIM never got his chance.

The plan is to give VIM a chance, starting with a fresh new install. I will track my every move, to help others jump into this world.

In this repo I will track the evolution my config files along with the rationale behind each addition.
